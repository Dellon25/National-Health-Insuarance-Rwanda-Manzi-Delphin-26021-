## üêç PART 2: PYTHON ANALYTICS TASKS

### ‚û°Ô∏è 1. Clean the Dataset
We began by inspecting for missing values, inconsistent formats, and extreme outliers. String values were normalized, and outliers in numerical fields were capped using IQR.

### ‚û°Ô∏è 2. Apply Data Transformations
Categorical values were encoded using LabelEncoder, and numerical features such as age, household size, and insurance value were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure modeling fairness.

### ‚û°Ô∏è 3. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We analyzed central tendencies, distributions, and correlations between variables. This helped us detect relationships and understand variable behavior.

#### Descriptive Statistics

#### Distribution Visuals
We used histograms and boxplots to observe feature spread and detect skews and group variances.

#### Correlation Analysis
This heatmap revealed strong and weak linear relationships between numeric indicators, guiding feature selection.

### ‚û°Ô∏è 4. Apply ML / Clustering

Given the nature of the health indicators, we used **K-Means Clustering** to group similar health insurance profiles.

#### Optimal Cluster Count
The elbow method was used to determine the best number of clusters (k).

<img width="978" height="483" alt="Elbow Method for Optimal K" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77432a1a-d2df-462f-909a-3b11df509b72" />


#### Cluster Visualization
We plotted clusters to identify patterns of insurance coverage and access grouped by similarity.

### ‚û°Ô∏è 5. Evaluate the Model

We evaluated clustering using the **Silhouette Score**, which indicated good separation and cohesion. For classification attempts, **Accuracy**, **Precision**, and **F1-Score** were computed.

### ‚û°Ô∏è 6. Structure Code & Add Innovation

- All code was modular with reusable functions
- Markdown cells explained each step
- A custom risk score metric was developed for households
- Feature importance from clustering enhanced interpretability

## üìä PART 3: POWER BI DASHBOARD TASKS

### ‚û°Ô∏è 1. Communicate the Problem & Insights
> The Power BI dashboard enables exploration of health insurance indicators by year, country, region, and demographic. It communicates disparities, trends, and patterns clearly.

### ‚û°Ô∏è 2. Incorporate Interactivity
- **Slicers** for `SurveyYear`, `Country`, `Indicator`, `CharacteristicCategory`
- **Drill-through** pages from overall indicators to demographic-specific reports

### ‚û°Ô∏è 3. Use Appropriate Visuals
- **Line Chart**: Trends over time
- **Clustered Column Chart**: Top indicators per region
- **Map**: Insurance values by country
- **Pie Chart**: Demographic proportions
- **Bar Chart**: Value per country

### ‚û°Ô∏è 4. Ensure Design Clarity
- Color theme: Blue/White (healthcare standard)
- Clearly labeled visuals, logical layout, grouped by insights
- KPI cards at the top for total indicators, average values

### ‚û°Ô∏è 5. Add Innovative Features
- Custom tooltips with CIHigh/CILow and precision
- DAX formulas: Value change, CI range
- AI Visual: Key influencers affecting insurance value
- Bookmarks to toggle between views

#### Problem Statement 

<img width="1282" height="711" alt="Problem Statement" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4525502c-9cd8-43ff-8ea5-1a51411602e8" />
